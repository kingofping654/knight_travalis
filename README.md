# knight_travalis
a really bad submission for The Odin Project assignment Knights Travalis

This code is designed to show off how the knight from chess can move from any one spot on a 8x8 chess board to any other spot on the board. The project was for me to create the fastest path for the knight to make. My code does not really take the fastst route but it always makes it to the target. It just might take a while.
This assignment was pretty tough as I'm not great at algorythm stuff but I did have fun once I figured out a way to accomplish the task. It may not be pretty or good but gosh dangit the code works.
